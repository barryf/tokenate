# Tokenate

Tokenate helps you generate test or other personal tokens from your
[Token Endpoint][tokenendpoint] with a specified scope.

The authorization and token endpoints in the form are preset to the
[Indieauth][] defaults.

Read more about authorization using your own website and tokens at
[IndieWeb.org][indieweb].
